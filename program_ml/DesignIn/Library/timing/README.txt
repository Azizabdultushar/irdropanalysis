README: Liberty Timing (.lib)
=============================

The timing files are characterized from Altos Liberate software. The timing are based on 2x2 constraint-table-template for tool demonstration purpose (shorten characterization time and small timing file). For actual silicon process, we recommend the 7x7 constraint-table-template for high accuracy.
